# NPC Therapy Game

## 🎮 Project Overview

This project is an interactive therapy simulation where players act as therapists helping 47 unique NPCs work through existential crises, digital consciousness issues, and meta-narrative struggles. The game is built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, and it uses the Pollinations.AI API for conversations and text-to-speech.
