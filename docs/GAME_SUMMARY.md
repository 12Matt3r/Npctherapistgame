You play as a silent therapist who listens to 10 NPCs from various game worlds as they lie on your therapy couch. Each character shares their existential pain of being trapped in repetitive loops, forgotten by heroes, and living the same moments endlessly.

### 💔 The NPCs

2. **Byte the Glitched Courier** (Cyberpunk) - A delivery robot trapped in endless routes
3. **Captain Loop** (Space) - A pilot stuck patrolling a sector for 11 years
4. **Daisy.exe** (AI/Dating Sim) - A program programmed to say "I love you" 17,000 times daily
5. **Rustjaw** (Post-Apocalyptic) - A mechanic who fixes engines that don't go anywhere
6. **Tiko the Quest Vendor** (RPG) - A shopkeeper watching heroes forget him repeatedly
7. **Luna-9** (Android) - A maid robot whose master deleted her but forgot her backup
8. **Worm** (Side-Scroller) - A villain who dies repeatedly in loops but keeps trying
9. **Bishop-47** (Tactical) - A soldier told to "hold position" for 11 years
10. **Pebble** (Platformer) - A sidekick used as a stepping stone, then abandoned
